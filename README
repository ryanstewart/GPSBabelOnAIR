GPSBabelOnAIR

This is a skeleton project, if you're interested in it, please let me know.

This library provides an ActionScript 3 wrapper to GPSBabel. It uses the NativeProcess
API in AIR 2 to call directly to GPSBabel from an AIR application. More info on AIR 2
can be found at http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/air2/

An example of how to use the NativeProcess API can be found in the examples folder.
